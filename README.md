## About

Spaceship is a **third-person platformer** game prototype where the player have to reach the server room to fix the **depleting oxygen** situation. The player can move quite freely while looking for a way through the level. There are two types of **pickup items**. The oxygen bottles that fill the oxygen bar which decreases over time. The second one are the toolboxes which increase the **player score**. The game ends when the player is out of oxygen or reaches the server room.
